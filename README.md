# React Nanodegree Third Project (Mobile Flashcards)

This is the third project of the Udacity's React Nanodegree course.

This project implements a flash cards app using React Native. Users are able to add decks, add cards to these decks, and do a quiz with the cards of one deck. The app also has notifications reminders, which reminds the user to study every day.

This App has only been tested on android devices.


To Run the app:
* Install and start the development server
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn start`
    - Open Expo DevTools on your browser and choose if you want to run the app on device or emulator.
